# Simon-Game

Simon Game is a web-based implementation of the classic memory game Simon. It was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

## Game rules
The game consists of four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed. The game generates a random sequence of button presses, which the player must replicate by clicking the buttons in the same order. The sequence starts with one button, and after each successful replication, the sequence grows by one button. If the player presses a wrong button or takes too long to press the correct one, the game ends.

## Features
Simon Game offers the following features:

•Interactive game board with colored buttons and sound effects.
•Random sequence generator with increasing difficulty.
•Scoreboard displaying the current and high score.
•Strict mode option, which resets the game on the first mistake.

## Usage
To play Simon Game, follow these steps:

1.Turn on the game by pressing the power button.
2.Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
3.Watch the sequence of button presses made by the game.
4.Replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
5.If you make a mistake, the game will display an "X" and reset the sequence (unless strict mode is on).
6.If you complete the sequence, the game will generate a new, longer sequence.
7.The game ends when you make a mistake and strict mode is off, or when you complete 20 sequences.
